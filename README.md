# Description:

This project provides a user-friendly interface for text summarization leveraging the power of BART (Bidirectional and Autoregressive Transformer) for effective text condensation. It offers the following functionalities:

Summarization: Accepts user input or text from a file and generates a concise summary using the pre-trained BART model.
User Input: Allows users to directly enter text for summarization, enhancing interactivity.
File Reading: Supports reading text from a file, providing flexibility in content selection.
Database Integration (Optional): Optionally integrates with a MySQL database (project database) for potential future data storage and retrieval functionalities.
# Key Features:

BART-based Summarization: Utilizes the state-of-the-art BART model to deliver high-quality summaries.
User-Centric Design: Prioritizes user experience with a simple and intuitive interface.
Text File Support: Facilitates convenient summarization of pre-existing text files.
# Technical Stack:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
tkinter: User interface framework
transformers: Access to BART model and tokenizer
pandas: Data manipulation (if applicable)
PIL: Image processing for background image (if applicable)
mysql.connector (Optional): MySQL database interaction
# Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x
Necessary libraries (install using pip install <library_name>)
Download the Code:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Run the Application:

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Execute python main.py to launch the graphical user interface.

# How It Works:

User Input: The user interacts with the graphical interface, either entering text directly or selecting a text file.
Text Processing: If a file is chosen, the text is read from the file.
BART Summarization: The input text is fed into the BART model, generating a summary.
Output Display: The generated summary is presented to the user in a pop-up window.
